Opened in 1973, it features two massive towers connected by walkways and a central section that can be raised to allow ships to pass through. The bridge's intricate Gothic-style architecture and Victorian engineering make it a must-visit attraction for tourists and locals alike. The architecture and materials used to build this bridge make it one of the strongest bridge designs.</p>

                The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge has two main towers that stand at a height of 297 meters above sea level. Its deck is supported by a stiffening truss which is a lattice-like structure that distributes the weight of the bridge evenly across the two towers. This truss also helps the bridge to withstand strong winds and earthquakes. BIM technology was used in its structural analysis and construction and is still being used in its ongoing maintenance. All of these features make it one of the best bridges in the world.</p>
