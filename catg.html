        Tower Bridge is one of the essential and iconic symbols of London, also famous as the greatest bridge in the world, combining both bascule (drawbridge) and suspension bridge elements. Opened in 1973, it features two massive towers connected by walkways and a central section that can be raised to allow ships to pass through. The bridge's intricate Gothic-style architecture and Victorian engineering make it a must-visit attraction for tourists and locals alike. The architecture and materials used to build this bridge make it one of the strongest bridge designs.</p>
