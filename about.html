          <h2>  Our Story</h2>
          <p id="stor">At Bridges, we are driven by a passion for building connections that stand the test of time. Our journey began with a single goal: to create bridges that not only span distances but also connect communities, cities, and nations.
      
            Founded with a vision of innovative engineering, Bridges has evolved into a leader in the design and construction of bridges worldwide. Our team of skilled engineers, architects, and construction experts work tirelessly to deliver bridges that are not just functional, but also architectural masterpieces that enhance the landscape and improve lives.
            
            We understand that every bridge we build tells a story of collaboration, precision, and dedication. Whether it's a suspension bridge soaring above rivers, a pedestrian bridge that unites neighborhoods, or a massive infrastructure project that drives economic growth, we take pride in every step of the journey.
            
            Our commitment to sustainability, safety, and cutting-edge technology ensures that our bridges will serve future generations. At Bridges, we don’t just build structures; we build lasting connections that help people move forward—together.
            
            Join us as we continue to bridge the gaps between today and tomorrow, one project at a time.</p>
